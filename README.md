### Inspiration ‚ú®
Typing is an essential skill for software engineers but is often overlooked in favor of other technical skills. MelodyType was created to provide a fun and interactive platform for improving typing speed and accuracy, inspired by the joy of music. Typing to the beat of a song combines rhythm and repetition, making the practice more enjoyable and effective.

5. Press `Enter` to submit each line of lyrics.


## Technical Details ‚öôÔ∏è
The game uses a simple yet effective algorithm to match user input with the lyrics. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- **Lyrics Fetching**: Lyrics are fetched from an external API (`https://api.lyrics.ovh`). The lyrics are then split into lines and displayed one line at a time.
- **Typing Detection**: The game listens for keyboard events and matches the user's input against the current line of lyrics. If the user types the correct character, it is removed from the display, giving immediate feedback.
- **Scrolling Mechanism**: When the user presses `Enter`, the game checks if the line is complete and scrolls to the next line of lyrics. The smooth scrolling effect is achieved using Phaser's tweening capabilities.
- **Music Synchronization**: The Howler.js library is used to play the selected song and manage playback events. The game ensures that the lyrics are typed in sync with the music, adding an extra layer of challenge.

### Design Choices
- **Phaser 3**: Chosen for its robust game development framework, providing all the necessary tools for creating interactive and engaging games.
- **Howler.js**: Selected for its powerful and easy-to-use audio API, enabling seamless music playback and control.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the game looks great and is fully functional on various screen sizes and devices.
